1. Installing the CloudWatch Agent
Before you begin, make sure you have an AWS account and access to the EC2 dashboard. Follow these steps to install the CloudWatch Agent on your Linux EC2 instance:

Sign in to AWS Console: Navigate to the AWS Management Console and sign in to your account.
Create an IAM Role: If you haven’t already, create an IAM role with permissions to run the CloudWatch Agent on your EC2 instance [6].
Launch EC2 Instance: Launch a new EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2 as the operating system. Make sure to assign the IAM role you created in the previous step.
Connect to EC2 Instance: Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance. Open a terminal and run the following command:
ssh -i <key_pair.pem> ec2-user@<public_dns>
Replace <key_pair.pem> with the path to your private key file and <public_dns> with your instance's public DNS [2].

Download the CloudWatch Agent Package: On your EC2 instance, download the CloudWatch Agent package using the following command:

wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/amazon_linux/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
Install the Agent: Install the CloudWatch Agent package using the package manager appropriate for your Linux distribution. For Amazon Linux 2, use the following command:

sudo rpm -U ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
Configure the Agent: After installation, configure the CloudWatch Agent by running the configuration wizard:

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
Start the Agent: Once configured, start the CloudWatch Agent service:

sudo systemctl start amazon-cloudwatch-agent
Verify Installation: Check the status of the CloudWatch Agent to ensure it’s running without errors:

sudo systemctl status amazon-cloudwatch-agent
